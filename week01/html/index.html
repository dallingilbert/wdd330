        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            With the example in the textbook, we can
            save data with a combination of JavaScript
            and HTML5, and make it look nice with CSS.
            JavaScript will allow us to determine what
            happens whenever someone takes a course of
            action, such as clicking a button on the
            page.<br><br> In our Story Editor example,
            we can click a button called "Save It" to
            store our data into a JavaScript object.
            Then when we click on "Display It" we can
            use JavaScript to display the story we typed
            into the input box.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there better ways to store data, such
                as using PHP or JavaScript?
            </li>
            <li>What are some things to avoid when we
                store user data? (Regarding security
                breaches if someone were to maliciously
                attack our website in search of sensitive
                information)
